# Shotgun

It is a quiz app in which some fixed problems will appear when you open it. When you give answers to those questions, you will get your score later. This app is very simple to use and becomes logical with the help of JavaScript. I used only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create it. This app is designed as a mini project to showcase on my resume.




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vibhum-dixit/Shotgun.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Shotgun
```

Start the server using vs code live server.
